    ðŸ’¡ Introduction

    This is an introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) section. By the end, you should 
    understand how classes, abstract classes, and metaclasses work in Python. You should also know 
    methods and their variations, attributes and their variations, as well as getters 
    (property in Python) and setters.

    I will also introduce some object-oriented programming concepts, such as Encapsulation, 
    Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism, as well as ways of relating objects, such as 
    association, aggregation and composition.

    We'll also talk about Python-specific features like: dataclasses, magic methods, 
    iterator protocol, docStrings, and more.

    As this is an extensive and more complex subject, continuation to this section is in one of 
    the last sections of this course, Section 15 - Design Patterns, where we will apply more 
    advanced features and design patterns using design-oriented programming. objects.
