    → Sets are collections of unordered elements that do not allow duplicate items, that is, 
    their elements are unique.
    
    → Sets cannot be changed (immutable)
    → Not ordered
    → Does not accept duplicate elements

    → When to use?
        It is recommended to use this type of collection when we want to work with single 
        elements. We can also use sets when there is a need to perform mathematical 
        operations with elements from different sets. Remember that because a set is 
        unordered, the elements can be in a different order each time the code runs.
