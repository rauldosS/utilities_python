'''
    ðŸ’¡ Fun Facts About Naming Conventions!

    As you saw in the previous lesson, we use certain conventions for naming variables, functions, 
    classes, and so on. These conventions have a name that we can use to refer to how we are 
    naming certain objects in our program: PascalCase, camelCase, and snake_case.

    ðŸ’¡ PascalCase:
        Means that all words start with a capital letter and nothing is used to separate them, like in: 
        MyClass, Class, MyObject, MyVeryCoolProgram. This is the convention used for classes in Python;

    ðŸ’¡ camelCase:
        the only difference from camelCase to PascalCase is the first letter. 
        In camelCase the first letter will always be lowercase and the rest of the words must 
        start with a capital letter. As in: myFunction,SumFunction, etc... This cast isn't 
        used in Python (although I confuse the two and sometimes end up calling camelCase 
        PascalCase or vice versa, but now you know the difference);

    ðŸ’¡ snake_case:
        This is the pattern used in Python to define anything that isn't a class. 
        All letters will be lowercase and separated by an underline, as in: my_variable, 
        legal_function, sum.

    The defaults used in Python are: snake_case for anything and PascalCase for classes.
