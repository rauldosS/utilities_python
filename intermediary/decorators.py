    â†’ Decorators

    â†’ A decorator in Python is an object that extends/modifies the functionality of a 
    function (or method) at runtime and is conceptually closer to Java annotation than 
    to the object-oriented decorator.

    â†’ They are used extensively to extract common code that must be applied to various functions.
